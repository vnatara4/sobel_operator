For this task, please write programs in C, to be compiled with GCC,
that will perform a simple image-processing task.  Your code should
be written with an emphasis on reducing run time while maintaining
good programming practices.

You may use the proveded code to read and write a pgm image file, but
all other code must be your own.  You are welcome to modify the
provided code in any way you see fit.

For this task, please write two different programs.  Each of the
programs should read in the provided kitten.pgm grayscale image file,
perform an operation on that image, and then save the output in a new
pgm file, leaving kitten.pgm unaltered.

1)  The first should implement a Sobel operator.  Please use Wikipedia
    for a more complete description of that operation.  In summary, you
	will process a grayscale image, and the result will be a new gray-scale
	image wher the intensity of each pixel corresponds to the magnitude 
	of the gradient at that pixel in the origional image.

2)	Implement a Sobel like operator with only a single kernel, where the
	kernel's size can be easily specified, and the coefficients readily
	specified at compile time.  You may assume that all of the
	coefficients are always integers.
